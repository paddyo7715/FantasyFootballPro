The New Team Form is used to create or edit a new team and has two <LineBreak/>tabs: <Bold>General</Bold> and <Bold>Uniform.</Bold>
<LineBreak/>  
<LineBreak/>  
<Bold>General:</Bold><LineBreak/>
On the general tab, you define team attributes, such as city and <LineBreak/>nickname, as well as the stadium that the team will call home.<LineBreak/>
Stadium Capacity is free-form, so you can put anthing you like into that <LineBreak/>field example: 72,000. 
<LineBreak/>
<LineBreak/>                
<Bold>Uniform</Bold><LineBreak/>
On the uniform tab, you define the new team's home and away uniform.  <LineBreak/>There are many elements to set for a uniform, and you will find a <LineBreak/>drop-down box next to each one.  
To set a color for a particular uniform <LineBreak/>attriubte, click on its color drop down box and select a color from <LineBreak/>either 
the Standard or Advanced tabs.  Note that there must be a <LineBreak/>selection for each uniform attribute and you must complete both the <LineBreak/>home and away uniforms.
Note that under the Standard tab of the color <LineBreak/>picker there is the Team Colors section.  The Team Colors section <LineBreak/>contains the colors that you have used thus far to design this team's <LineBreak/>unform.  
This is helpful if you have selected one or more colors from the <LineBreak/>advanced tab and you don't want to keep selecting that color from the <LineBreak/>advanced tab if you want to use that color for another part of the <LineBreak/>uniform.
Note that blank helmets are available in <LineBreak/>C:\Users\Brenden\source\repos\FantasyFootballPro\FntasyFootballPro\<LineBreak/>Images\Helmets
